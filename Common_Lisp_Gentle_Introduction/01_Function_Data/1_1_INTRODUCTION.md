##1.1 INTRODUCTION

This chapter begins with an overview of the notions of function and data,
followed by examples of several built-in Lisp functions. If you already have
some experience programming in other languages, you can flip through this
chapter in just a few minutes. You’ll see arithmetic functions, followed by an
introduction to symbols, one of the key datatypes of Lisp, and predicates,
which answer yes-or-no questions. When you think you’ve grasped this
material, read the summary section on page 26 to test your understanding.
If you’re new to programming, this chapter is designed specifically for
you. We’ll start by explaining what functions and data are.* The term data
means information, such as numbers, words, or lists of things. You can think
of a function as a box through which data flows. The function operates on the
data in some way, and the result is what flows out.
After covering some of the built-in functions provided by Lisp, we will
learn how to put existing functions together to make new ones—the essence of
computer programming. Several useful techniques for creating new functions
will then be presented.

the book.
