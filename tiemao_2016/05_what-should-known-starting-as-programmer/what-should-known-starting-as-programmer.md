> ### 给年轻开发者的8个职场建议


As the old Faces song "[Ooh La La](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ooh_La_La_(Faces_song))" goes, I wish that I knew what I know now when I was younger. Back then, I simply loved to code and could have cared less about my "career" or about playing well with others. I could have saved myself a ton of trouble if I'd just followed a few simple practices.

老面孔的歌“哦啦啦”,我希望我知道现在我知道我年轻的时候。当时,


##1.Take names.

I was really focused on computers early in my career and considered people to be minor annoyances who kept me from being one with my beloved machine. OK, I'm exaggerating a little. Despite meeting many industry luminaries and people that would have been worthwhile to befriend, I didn't keep any business cards. I didn't bother to remember their names and never checked in on them. I only went to user groups (there wasn't meetup.com when I started and it wasn't a big thing for a while after) when I needed a job.

## 1.取的名字。

我很关注电脑在我职业生涯的早期,认为人是小烦恼使我和我心爱的人从一个机器。好吧,我夸张一点.尽管许多行业名人和会议是值得交朋友的人,我没有保留任何名片.我没有费心去记住他们的名字,从来没有检入。我只去了用户组(没有聚会.com当我开始也不是一件大事后一段时间)当我需要一份工作。


I realize the concept of needing a job seems a little quaint to some of you [younger developers](http://www.infoworld.com/d/application-development/r-u-mdrn-how-lure-hipster-hackers-240650). But take it from me -- there've been times when merely saying you're a developer and knowing basic syntax and how to search (there was no Google when I started) was not enough to [find immediate employment](http://www.infoworld.com/d/application-development/tech-boom-the-war-top-developer-talent-231709). There was a time when developers actually called headhunters versus being [spammed by them endlessly](http://www.infoworld.com/d/application-development/stop-headhunters-ruining-meetups-234791). This will happen again, eventually.

我意识到需要工作的概念似乎有点古怪的你年轻的开发人员.但相信我的话,有时一直只是说你是一名开发人员和了解基本语法以及如何搜索(没有谷歌当我开始)并不足以找到立竿见影 就业。曾经有一段时间当开发人员实际上叫做猎头和被他们无休止的骚扰。这将会再次发生,最终。


More important, a lot of developers who were more skilled than I am have had far less interesting careers and less success because they never put themselves out there. They never met the right people at the right moments. Hey, timing and luck are great, but you also make your own opportunities. The first nine times you go to a large gathering and no one speaks to you and you're left with all the perks of being a wallflower are practice for the 10th time when you meet someone interesting.

更重要的是,很多比我更熟练的开发人员有更有趣的职业,更不成功,因为他们从不把自己.他们没有遇到正确的人在正确的时刻。嘿,时机和运气很好,但你也使自己的机会.第一个9倍你去一个大型聚会,没有人对你说话时,你剩下的所有津贴做壁花,第十次练习当你遇到有趣的人。


Also, take note of your peers. If you're an early 20-something, chances are you have no real power or influence, and neither do your peers. In five to 10 years, that will all be different and the person who you ignored because they were boring and couldn't help you will be the person who could have won you an important opportunity.

同时,注意你的同行。如果你是一个20多岁的早期,你没有真正的权力或影响力,也不做你的同行。在5到10年,都是不同的,你忽略了因为他们无聊的人,不能帮助你将能赢得了你的一个重要机会的人。


## 2. Problem solving. 

Luckily, this came pretty naturally to me after a while, but early on it was a struggle. The trick is tonever fall in love with any one theory of the problem. Pick three theories and go about proving them wrong rather than trying to prove yourself right. Also, gravitate toward alternative theories. If something says there is a port conflict and you can't find any port conflict, then maybe you're connecting to the wrong network device or an unassigned IP address, and the error is bogus.

## 2. 解决问题

幸运的是, 后来慢慢的我就明白这个道理了。关键是不要迷信什么教条理论. 选择三个理论去证明他们错了而不要试图去证明自己是正确的。此外,倾向于替代方案. 如果提示说有端口冲突, 你却找不到任何端口冲突, 那也许你连接的网络不对,或者是IP地址未赋值,等等,也许连错误提示也是错误的。


Problem solving is essentially the same thing you learned in abstract in seventh or eighth grade or whenever you learned simple algebra. Remove all of the variables that you can, then solve for x.

解决问题在本质上和中学时学过的代数很类似。消除所有可消除的变量,然后求出x。


## 3.Pick your language or other technical specialties based on the market and your career goals. 

Sure, you want to do what you love, but really is Scala (insert other language name here) your real love in life, to the point where you are willing to tie your success or failure to it? A better reason would be that it is a smaller talent pool and you might be able to make more money doing it and you know that the finance and scientific community near you is big enough and using it avidly. (It also might be you want to work for Typesafe.)

## 3. 根据市场需求或职业规划选取一种语言/技术

当然, 你想用喜欢的语言, 但 Python 真的是你的最爱吗?(此处可代入任意其他语言).  你想将宝压在哪个上面? 是否比较小众, 可以赚更多的钱, 或者是因为企业和社区使用广泛? (也可能是你想去的公司用这种技术)


Either way, pick rationally rather than based on some weird zeal for a syntax. [Hadoop is wicked cool](http://www.infoworld.com/d/application-development/know-right-now-about-hadoop-242934), that's a fact. However, analysts are predicting the market will grow several times in the next couple of years, and there is a huge uptake. Companies are building out major infrastructure in a way I haven't seen since the '90s. I think [PaaS is awesome](http://www.infoworld.com/d/cloud-computing/which-freaking-paas-should-i-use-204189), but I do not see tons of business opportunity for developers here. Publicly show passion and enthusiasm, but privately make this a cold, hard calculus and business decision. Your favorite technology will be dead probably before the end of your career anyhow.

无论如何, 请选一个靠谱点的语言, 而不要因为语法奇怪或者仅仅是热情。[Hadoop吊炸天](http://www.infoworld.com/d/application-development/know-right-now-about-hadoop-242934),这是一个事实。分析师预计在未来几年市场将会增长好几倍, 所以有巨大的上升空间. 各个公司也正在建设大型的基础设施,这是我的从90年代以来就没见过的事。我认为 [PaaS是极好的](http://www.infoworld.com/d/cloud-computing/which-freaking-paas-should-i-use-204189), 但在这个行当我看不到对开发人员有什么商机. 公开释放你的激情和热情, 但私下里请把细细斟酌。你最喜欢的技术可能没几年就死了。


## 4.There is relatively little real innovation in the software side of the industry compared to popular perception. 

Most of us who have done this for more than five years have already watched all the vendors rename everything and sell it as new at least once. Anyone working for more than 10 years has seen it a few times. When you go into a meeting with a bunch of old people, realize that they roll their eyes at many of the things you think are new. There are some innovations, but those are usually combinations of previous technologies. While Hadoop may be hot, HDFS is a distributed filesystem and distributed filesystems have existed for decades.


## 4. 软件行业真正的创新很少,想象中更少

在这行干了5年的人, 应该能看到有很多东西换汤不换药, 厂商改个名字重新包装下又可以再大卖一次。如果你工作了10年, 可能见的次数更多。当你和老程序员交流时,你会发现你觉得很时髦的东西,他们却不以为然. 是有一些创新, 但大多都是讲以前的技术进行一下组合。尽管 Hadoop 很火爆, 但 HDFS 只是一个分布式文件系统(distributed filesystem), 而分布式文件系统已经存在很多年了。


## 5.Think in terms of a career, not a series of jobs. 

When I started I job-hopped for relatively dumb reasons: I didn't like that I was put in a cubicle, I could get an extra $5 per hour, and so on. This would come back to haunt me during the dot-bomb. At the same time, I usually failed to pick jobs for the best reason: What will help me progress in my career? Sometimes that means taking a job for less money but more responsibility or better opportunities. I probably still have put in my time at big companies -- then quit working for them sooner. It's relatively hard to make an impact from the inside of IT in a big company and opportunities are frequently limited.


## 5.这是你的事业, 而不只是一份又一份的工作。

刚工作的时候我一直在跳槽,想想也挺傻的: 工位小, 工资低,等等等等. 这将在dot-bomb回来困扰着我。那时候, 并不会想真正有用的东西: 对自己的未来有帮助吗? 一般来说工资低一些无所谓, 但要能有更多的机会承担责任或者是有更好的发展空间。我可能还是会进大公司 —— 然后就辞职不干了. 大公司的IT部门想晋升很难,而且机会相对也比较少。


## 6.Work more than 40 hours per week. 

I don't mean you should work in a sweatshop or run yourself to death, but make a personal investment in your career. If the only time you learn something is on your boss's dime, then prepare to have your options limited -- your boss isn't going to train you to make sure you have options.


## 6. 每周工作40小时以上

并不是让你在外包公司里把自己累死, 但也应该多花一些时间在工作上. 如果你只在上班时间学习(公司用到的技术), 那么未来可选择的路也就很狭窄, 而公司只会根据自身利益来培养你。


## 7.Programming is not hard unless you make it hard. 

I disagree with Joseph Gentle. People are still messing up software development in the same dumb ways since software separated from hardware. Programming simply requires reading, concentration, and logic. Luckily, plenty of books, courses, and patterns can tell you how to do all of that (see No. 6). Coordination with other people on any scale? That's hard.

## 7.编程并不难

我不同意 Joseph Gentle 的观点。在软件和硬件分离以后, 大众仍然把软件开发搞的一团糟. 编程需要的仅仅是**阅读**(reading)、**专注**(concentration)以及**逻辑思维**(logic)。幸运的是, 有大量的书籍、课程和模式可以告诉你该如何去做(参见第6点). 在开发中和别人进行很好的协作? 这倒是有点难度。


## 8.For Zod's sake, learn to communicate. 

If you are unable to write properly in English (or the appropriate language for your community), take a writing course. If you are unable to give a talk, get over your stage fright, take a course, practice in front of a mirror, and/or attend some meetups and learn. This is probably as important as writing code.

## 8. 说句心里话, 请学会沟通。


如果你的写作不好, 可以报名参加培训班。如果你不擅长与人交谈, 请克服怯场, 参加一些交流培训班, 或者在镜子前自己练习, 也可以参加一些交流活动或者讲座。这可能和写代码一样重要。


Now it's your turn. If you're more than five years in, what do you wish you'd known at the start? If you're less than five years in, what advice have you found helpful?


现在, 轮到你了。如果你工作超过五年, 你想在刚入行的时候知道什么? 如果你工作不到5年, 还有什么比较好的建议吗?
