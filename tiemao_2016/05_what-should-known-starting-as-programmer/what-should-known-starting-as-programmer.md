#  [好文推荐] 给年轻开发者的8条建议


As the old Faces song "[Ooh La La](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ooh_La_La_(Faces_song))" goes, I wish that I knew what I know now when I was younger. Back then, I simply loved to code and could have cared less about my "career" or about playing well with others. I could have saved myself a ton of trouble if I'd just followed a few simple practices.


如同老歌 "[Ooh La La](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ooh_La_La_(Faces_song))" 所唱的一样,我多希望年轻时就学到那些现在才懂的道理呀。那时候,我心里只有代码,不会去思考职业生涯，也不会主动去和别人维持良好的关系。如果遵循一些简单的原则,那至少就不会一次次地掉进坑里,要少操多少心呀!


##1.Take names.

I was really focused on computers early in my career and considered people to be minor annoyances who kept me from being one with my beloved machine. OK, I'm exaggerating a little. Despite meeting many industry luminaries and people that would have been worthwhile to befriend, I didn't keep any business cards. I didn't bother to remember their names and never checked in on them. I only went to user groups (there wasn't meetup.com when I started and it wasn't a big thing for a while after) when I needed a job.

## 1.记住联系方式

我刚毕业时一门心思都扑在计算机上,如果谁让我离开心爱的电脑甚至会比较反感。好吧,这样说可能夸张了一点. 尽管认识很多行内专家,参加各种交流会议也认识了很多值得交往的朋友, 但很可惜,没有存下来他们的任何名片,或者是通讯方式. 也没有花心思去记。只有在找工作时会加一些邮箱联系人(那时候还没有 meetup.com, 也没有微信)。


I realize the concept of needing a job seems a little quaint to some of you [younger developers](http://www.infoworld.com/d/application-development/r-u-mdrn-how-lure-hipster-hackers-240650). But take it from me -- there've been times when merely saying you're a developer and knowing basic syntax and how to search (there was no Google when I started) was not enough to [find immediate employment](http://www.infoworld.com/d/application-development/tech-boom-the-war-top-developer-talent-231709). There was a time when developers actually called headhunters versus being [spammed by them endlessly](http://www.infoworld.com/d/application-development/stop-headhunters-ruining-meetups-234791). This will happen again, eventually.


对于 [现在的程序员](http://www.infoworld.com/d/application-development/r-u-mdrn-how-lure-hipster-hackers-240650) 来说, “需要工作” 这个概念可能有点古怪. 但说真的, 那时候如果你只会点基本的语法和使用搜索引擎(还没有谷歌), [短时间内很难找到工作]((http://www.infoworld.com/d/application-development/tech-boom-the-war-top-developer-talent-231709))。曾经有一段时间程序员把找猎头称为是 [无尽的骚扰]((http://www.infoworld.com/d/application-development/stop-headhunters-ruining-meetups-234791))。以后的日子里这很可能会再次发生。


More important, a lot of developers who were more skilled than I am have had far less interesting careers and less success because they never put themselves out there. They never met the right people at the right moments. Hey, timing and luck are great, but you also make your own opportunities. The first nine times you go to a large gathering and no one speaks to you and you're left with all the perks of being a wallflower are practice for the 10th time when you meet someone interesting.


更重要的是, 很多比我经验丰富的程序员工作也不开心,甚至不能算是成功。或者是没有机会,或者是没有在正确的时间遇到合适的人。确实, 时机和运气都很重要, 但你也可以自己创造机会. 可能前9次你去参加交流活动都没人和你聊得来,你只是去做鲜花和陪衬, 但也许第十次你就会遇到真正的贵人。


Also, take note of your peers. If you're an early 20-something, chances are you have no real power or influence, and neither do your peers. In five to 10 years, that will all be different and the person who you ignored because they were boring and couldn't help you will be the person who could have won you an important opportunity.

同时, 关注你的小伙伴(peers)。如果在20岁左右, 你没有什么威望和影响力, 你的小伙伴也差不多是这样。但5到10年之后,情况就不一样了,你觉得无聊或者烦人的那些人,很可能会帮助你得到某些重要的机会。


## 2. Problem solving. 

Luckily, this came pretty naturally to me after a while, but early on it was a struggle. The trick is tonever fall in love with any one theory of the problem. Pick three theories and go about proving them wrong rather than trying to prove yourself right. Also, gravitate toward alternative theories. If something says there is a port conflict and you can't find any port conflict, then maybe you're connecting to the wrong network device or an unassigned IP address, and the error is bogus.

## 2. 解决问题

幸运的是, 后来慢慢的我就明白这个道理了。关键是不要迷信什么教条理论. 选择三个理论去证明他们错了而不要试图去证明自己是正确的。此外,倾向于替代方案. 如果提示说有端口冲突, 你却找不到任何端口冲突, 那也许你连接的网络不对,或者是IP地址未赋值,等等,也许连错误提示也是错误的。


Problem solving is essentially the same thing you learned in abstract in seventh or eighth grade or whenever you learned simple algebra. Remove all of the variables that you can, then solve for x.

解决问题在本质上和中学时学过的代数很类似。消除所有可消除的变量,然后求出x。


## 3.Pick your language or other technical specialties based on the market and your career goals. 

Sure, you want to do what you love, but really is Scala (insert other language name here) your real love in life, to the point where you are willing to tie your success or failure to it? A better reason would be that it is a smaller talent pool and you might be able to make more money doing it and you know that the finance and scientific community near you is big enough and using it avidly. (It also might be you want to work for Typesafe.)

## 3. 根据市场需求或职业规划选取一种语言/技术

当然, 你想用喜欢的语言, 但 Python 真的是你的最爱吗?(此处可代入任意其他语言).  你想将宝压在哪个上面? 是否比较小众, 可以赚更多的钱, 或者是因为企业和社区使用广泛? (也可能是你想去的公司用这种技术)


Either way, pick rationally rather than based on some weird zeal for a syntax. [Hadoop is wicked cool](http://www.infoworld.com/d/application-development/know-right-now-about-hadoop-242934), that's a fact. However, analysts are predicting the market will grow several times in the next couple of years, and there is a huge uptake. Companies are building out major infrastructure in a way I haven't seen since the '90s. I think [PaaS is awesome](http://www.infoworld.com/d/cloud-computing/which-freaking-paas-should-i-use-204189), but I do not see tons of business opportunity for developers here. Publicly show passion and enthusiasm, but privately make this a cold, hard calculus and business decision. Your favorite technology will be dead probably before the end of your career anyhow.

无论如何, 请选一个靠谱点的语言, 而不要因为语法奇怪或者仅仅是热情。[Hadoop吊炸天](http://www.infoworld.com/d/application-development/know-right-now-about-hadoop-242934),这是一个事实。分析师预计在未来几年市场将会增长好几倍, 所以有巨大的上升空间. 各个公司也正在建设大型的基础设施,这是我的从90年代以来就没见过的事。我认为 [PaaS是极好的](http://www.infoworld.com/d/cloud-computing/which-freaking-paas-should-i-use-204189), 但在这个行当我看不到对开发人员有什么商机. 公开释放你的激情和热情, 但私下里请把细细斟酌。你最喜欢的技术可能没几年就死了。


## 4.There is relatively little real innovation in the software side of the industry compared to popular perception. 

Most of us who have done this for more than five years have already watched all the vendors rename everything and sell it as new at least once. Anyone working for more than 10 years has seen it a few times. When you go into a meeting with a bunch of old people, realize that they roll their eyes at many of the things you think are new. There are some innovations, but those are usually combinations of previous technologies. While Hadoop may be hot, HDFS is a distributed filesystem and distributed filesystems have existed for decades.


## 4. 软件行业真正的创新很少,想象中更少

在这行干了5年的人, 应该能看到有很多东西换汤不换药, 厂商改个名字重新包装下又可以再大卖一次。如果你工作了10年, 可能见的次数更多。当你和老程序员交流时,你会发现你觉得很时髦的东西,他们却不以为然. 是有一些创新, 但大多都是讲以前的技术进行一下组合。尽管 Hadoop 很火爆, 但 HDFS 只是一个分布式文件系统(distributed filesystem), 而分布式文件系统已经存在很多年了。


## 5.Think in terms of a career, not a series of jobs. 

When I started I job-hopped for relatively dumb reasons: I didn't like that I was put in a cubicle, I could get an extra $5 per hour, and so on. This would come back to haunt me during the dot-bomb. At the same time, I usually failed to pick jobs for the best reason: What will help me progress in my career? Sometimes that means taking a job for less money but more responsibility or better opportunities. I probably still have put in my time at big companies -- then quit working for them sooner. It's relatively hard to make an impact from the inside of IT in a big company and opportunities are frequently limited.


## 5.这是你的事业, 而不只是一份又一份的工作。

刚工作的时候我一直在跳槽,想想也挺傻的: 工位小, 工资低,等等等等. 这将在dot-bomb回来困扰着我。那时候, 并不会想真正有用的东西: 对自己的未来有帮助吗? 一般来说工资低一些无所谓, 但要能有更多的机会承担责任或者是有更好的发展空间。我可能还是会进大公司 —— 然后就辞职不干了. 大公司的IT部门想晋升很难,而且机会相对也比较少。


## 6.Work more than 40 hours per week. 

I don't mean you should work in a sweatshop or run yourself to death, but make a personal investment in your career. If the only time you learn something is on your boss's dime, then prepare to have your options limited -- your boss isn't going to train you to make sure you have options.


## 6. 每周工作40小时以上

并不是让你在外包公司里把自己累死, 但也应该多花一些时间在工作上. 如果你只在上班时间学习(公司用到的技术), 那么未来可选择的路也就很狭窄, 而公司只会根据自身利益来培养你。


## 7.Programming is not hard unless you make it hard. 

I disagree with Joseph Gentle. People are still messing up software development in the same dumb ways since software separated from hardware. Programming simply requires reading, concentration, and logic. Luckily, plenty of books, courses, and patterns can tell you how to do all of that (see No. 6). Coordination with other people on any scale? That's hard.

## 7.编程并不难

我不同意 Joseph Gentle 的观点。在软件和硬件分离以后, 大众仍然把软件开发搞的一团糟. 编程需要的仅仅是**阅读**(reading)、**专注**(concentration)以及**逻辑思维**(logic)。幸运的是, 有大量的书籍、课程和模式可以告诉你该如何去做(参见第6点). 在开发中和别人进行很好的协作? 这倒是有点难度。


## 8.For Zod's sake, learn to communicate. 

If you are unable to write properly in English (or the appropriate language for your community), take a writing course. If you are unable to give a talk, get over your stage fright, take a course, practice in front of a mirror, and/or attend some meetups and learn. This is probably as important as writing code.

## 8. 说句心里话, 请学会沟通。


如果你的写作不好, 可以报名参加培训班。如果你不擅长与人交谈, 请克服怯场, 参加一些交流培训班, 或者在镜子前自己练习, 也可以参加一些交流活动或者讲座。这可能和写代码一样重要。


Now it's your turn. If you're more than five years in, what do you wish you'd known at the start? If you're less than five years in, what advice have you found helpful?


现在, 轮到你了。如果你工作超过五年, 你想在刚入行的时候知道什么? 如果你工作不到5年, 还有什么比较好的建议吗?
