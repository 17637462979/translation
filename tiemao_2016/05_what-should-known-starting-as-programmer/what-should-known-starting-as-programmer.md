> ### 给年轻开发者的8个职场建议


As the old Faces song "[Ooh La La](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ooh_La_La_(Faces_song))" goes, I wish that I knew what I know now when I was younger. Back then, I simply loved to code and could have cared less about my "career" or about playing well with others. I could have saved myself a ton of trouble if I'd just followed a few simple practices.

老面孔的歌“哦啦啦”,我希望我知道现在我知道我年轻的时候。当时,


##1.Take names.

I was really focused on computers early in my career and considered people to be minor annoyances who kept me from being one with my beloved machine. OK, I'm exaggerating a little. Despite meeting many industry luminaries and people that would have been worthwhile to befriend, I didn't keep any business cards. I didn't bother to remember their names and never checked in on them. I only went to user groups (there wasn't meetup.com when I started and it wasn't a big thing for a while after) when I needed a job.

1.取的名字。我很关注电脑在我职业生涯的早期,认为人是小烦恼使我和我心爱的人从一个机器。好吧,我夸张一点.尽管许多行业名人和会议是值得交朋友的人,我没有保留任何名片.我没有费心去记住他们的名字,从来没有检入。我只去了用户组(没有聚会.com当我开始也不是一件大事后一段时间)当我需要一份工作。


I realize the concept of needing a job seems a little quaint to some of you [younger developers](http://www.infoworld.com/d/application-development/r-u-mdrn-how-lure-hipster-hackers-240650). But take it from me -- there've been times when merely saying you're a developer and knowing basic syntax and how to search (there was no Google when I started) was not enough to [find immediate employment](http://www.infoworld.com/d/application-development/tech-boom-the-war-top-developer-talent-231709). There was a time when developers actually called headhunters versus being [spammed by them endlessly](http://www.infoworld.com/d/application-development/stop-headhunters-ruining-meetups-234791). This will happen again, eventually.

我意识到需要工作的概念似乎有点古怪的你年轻的开发人员.但相信我的话,有时一直只是说你是一名开发人员和了解基本语法以及如何搜索(没有谷歌当我开始)并不足以找到立竿见影 就业。曾经有一段时间当开发人员实际上叫做猎头和被他们无休止的骚扰。这将会再次发生,最终。


More important, a lot of developers who were more skilled than I am have had far less interesting careers and less success because they never put themselves out there. They never met the right people at the right moments. Hey, timing and luck are great, but you also make your own opportunities. The first nine times you go to a large gathering and no one speaks to you and you're left with all the perks of being a wallflower are practice for the 10th time when you meet someone interesting.

更重要的是,很多比我更熟练的开发人员有更有趣的职业,更不成功,因为他们从不把自己.他们没有遇到正确的人在正确的时刻。嘿,时机和运气很好,但你也使自己的机会.第一个9倍你去一个大型聚会,没有人对你说话时,你剩下的所有津贴做壁花,第十次练习当你遇到有趣的人。


Also, take note of your peers. If you're an early 20-something, chances are you have no real power or influence, and neither do your peers. In five to 10 years, that will all be different and the person who you ignored because they were boring and couldn't help you will be the person who could have won you an important opportunity.

同时,注意你的同行。如果你是一个20多岁的早期,你没有真正的权力或影响力,也不做你的同行。在5到10年,都是不同的,你忽略了因为他们无聊的人,不能帮助你将能赢得了你的一个重要机会的人。


## 2. Problem solving. 

Luckily, this came pretty naturally to me after a while, but early on it was a struggle. The trick is tonever fall in love with any one theory of the problem. Pick three theories and go about proving them wrong rather than trying to prove yourself right. Also, gravitate toward alternative theories. If something says there is a port conflict and you can't find any port conflict, then maybe you're connecting to the wrong network device or an unassigned IP address, and the error is bogus.

2.解决问题。幸运的是,这是很自然的给我一段时间后,但这是一个早期斗争。关键是tonever爱上任何一个问题的理论.选择三个理论去证明他们错了而不是试图证明自己是正确的。此外,倾向于选择理论.如果东西说有一个端口冲突,你找不到任何端口冲突,那么也许你连接到错误的网络设备或未赋值的IP地址,和错误是伪造的。


Problem solving is essentially the same thing you learned in abstract in seventh or eighth grade or whenever you learned simple algebra. Remove all of the variables that you can, then solve for x.

解决问题在本质上是相同的,您了解了在抽象在第七或第八年级或当你学会简单的代数。删除所有的变量,你可以,然后求出x。


## 3.Pick your language or other technical specialties based on the market and your career goals. 

Sure, you want to do what you love, but really is Scala (insert other language name here) your real love in life, to the point where you are willing to tie your success or failure to it? A better reason would be that it is a smaller talent pool and you might be able to make more money doing it and you know that the finance and scientific community near you is big enough and using it avidly. (It also might be you want to work for Typesafe.)

3.所示。选择你的语言或其他技术专业基于市场和你的职业目标。当然,你想做你喜欢的,但真的是Scala(插入其他语言的名字)你的真正的爱情在生活中,,你愿意把你的成功或失败?更好的原因是,它是一个较小的人才库和你可以赚更多的钱,你知道附近的金融和科学界你是足够大的,使用它 贪婪地。(这也可能是你想要为类型安全工作。)


Either way, pick rationally rather than based on some weird zeal for a syntax. [Hadoop is wicked cool](http://www.infoworld.com/d/application-development/know-right-now-about-hadoop-242934), that's a fact. However, analysts are predicting the market will grow several times in the next couple of years, and there is a huge uptake. Companies are building out major infrastructure in a way I haven't seen since the '90s. I think [PaaS is awesome](http://www.infoworld.com/d/cloud-computing/which-freaking-paas-should-i-use-204189), but I do not see tons of business opportunity for developers here. Publicly show passion and enthusiasm, but privately make this a cold, hard calculus and business decision. Your favorite technology will be dead probably before the end of your career anyhow.

无论哪种方式,选择合理的而不是基于语法的一些奇怪的热情。Hadoop是邪恶的酷,这是一个事实。然而,分析师预计市场将增长几倍在未来的几年中,有一个巨大的吸收.公司正在建设大型基础设施的方式90年代以来我就没见过。我认为PaaS是可怕的,但我没有看到大量的商业机会为开发人员.公开展示的激情和热情,但私下里把这个感冒,微积分和业务决策。你最喜欢的技术可能会死在年底前你的事业。


## 4.There is relatively little real innovation in the software side of the industry compared to popular perception. 

Most of us who have done this for more than five years have already watched all the vendors rename everything and sell it as new at least once. Anyone working for more than 10 years has seen it a few times. When you go into a meeting with a bunch of old people, realize that they roll their eyes at many of the things you think are new. There are some innovations, but those are usually combinations of previous technologies. While Hadoop may be hot, HDFS is a distributed filesystem and distributed filesystems have existed for decades.

4.所示。有相对较少的真正的创新软件的行业相比,受欢迎的感觉.大部分的人都做了五年多已经所有的供应商重命名和出售一切看着新的至少一次.任何工作了10多年见过几次。当你进入会见一群老人,意识到他们不以为然,你认为的许多东西都是新的.有一些创新,但这些通常是先前技术的组合。尽管Hadoop可能热,HDFS是分布式文件系统和分布式文件系统已经存在了几十年。


## 5.Think in terms of a career, not a series of jobs. 

When I started I job-hopped for relatively dumb reasons: I didn't like that I was put in a cubicle, I could get an extra $5 per hour, and so on. This would come back to haunt me during the dot-bomb. At the same time, I usually failed to pick jobs for the best reason: What will help me progress in my career? Sometimes that means taking a job for less money but more responsibility or better opportunities. I probably still have put in my time at big companies -- then quit working for them sooner. It's relatively hard to make an impact from the inside of IT in a big company and opportunities are frequently limited.

5.认为的职业,而不是一系列的工作。当我开始我频繁跳槽的原因比较笨:我不喜欢,我被安排在一个房间,我可以得到一个额外的每小时5美元,等等.这将在dot-bomb回来困扰着我。在同一时间,我通常没有选择就业最好的理由:将帮助我在我职业生涯的进步?有时这意味着更少的钱的工作,但更多的责任或更好的机会。我可能还会花时间在大公司——然后辞职提前为他们工作.相对很难从内部产生影响的一个大公司和机会往往有限。


## 6.Work more than 40 hours per week. 

I don't mean you should work in a sweatshop or run yourself to death, but make a personal investment in your career. If the only time you learn something is on your boss's dime, then prepare to have your options limited -- your boss isn't going to train you to make sure you have options.

6.每周工作超过40小时。我的意思是你不应该在血汗工厂工作或运行自己死亡,但个人投资在你的职业生涯.如果你学习的唯一一次是在你老板的硬币,然后准备你的选择有限,你的老板不会培养你确保你有选择。


## 7.Programming is not hard unless you make it hard. 

I disagree with Joseph Gentle. People are still messing up software development in the same dumb ways since software separated from hardware. Programming simply requires reading, concentration, and logic. Luckily, plenty of books, courses, and patterns can tell you how to do all of that (see No. 6). Coordination with other people on any scale? That's hard.

7.所示。编程并不难,除非你很难。我不同意约瑟夫温柔。人们仍把软件开发的软件与硬件分离以来同样愚蠢的方式.编程只需要阅读、浓度和逻辑。幸运的是,大量的书籍、课程和模式可以告诉你如何去做的(见6号).在任何规模的协调与他人?这是困难的。


## 8.For Zod's sake, learn to communicate. 

If you are unable to write properly in English (or the appropriate language for your community), take a writing course. If you are unable to give a talk, get over your stage fright, take a course, practice in front of a mirror, and/or attend some meetups and learn. This is probably as important as writing code.

8.为了萨德,学会沟通。如果你不能用英语写正确的适合你的社区(或语言),写作课程。如果你不能给一个说话,克服怯场,当然,在镜子前练习,和/或参加一些聚会和学习。这可能是编写代码一样重要。


Now it's your turn. If you're more than five years in, what do you wish you'd known at the start? If you're less than five years in, what advice have you found helpful?


现在轮到你了。如果你超过五年,你想知道什么开始?如果你不到5年,建议你找到什么有用吗?
