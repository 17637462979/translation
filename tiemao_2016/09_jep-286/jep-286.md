OpenJDK提出JEP-286计划: 局部变量类型推断
==




A new plan proposed for OpenJDK would give Java a local-variable type inference capability so that it's easier to write code while continuing with static type safety.


OpenJDK 提出一个新的计划, 准备为 Java 增加局部变量类型推断功能(local-variable type inference capability), 这样可以写代码可以更简单, 同时还具有静态类型安全的特性。


The measure was proposed earlier this month in [JEP (JDK Enhancement Proposal (JEP) 286](http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/286). Documentation currently does not cite a version of Java where the improvement would be featured.


这个计划是在本月上旬提出的,文档地址为: [JEP-286(JDK Enhancement Proposal,JDK增强方案)](http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/286)。 目前没有指定具体的Java版本号,应该会在以后的版本中实现。


"We seek to improve the developer experience by reducing the ceremony associated with writing Java code while maintaining Java's commitment to static type safety by allowing developers to elide the often-unnecessary manifest declaration of local variable types," the proposal states. Other statically typed curly braced languages, such as C++, Scala, and Go, already support some variant of local-type inference. "Java is nearly the only popular statically typed language that has not embraced local-variable type inference," the JEP stresses. "At this point, this should no longer be a controversial feature."


提案中说到: "We seek to improve the developer experience by reducing the ceremony associated with writing Java code while maintaining Java's commitment to static type safety by allowing developers to elide the often-unnecessary manifest declaration of local variable types, (我们致力于改善开发人员在编程上的体验, 减少非必要的代码量,同时保持Java静态类型安全的承诺,允许开发者省略不必要的变量类型声明)"
其他的静态类型语言, 如 C++, Scala, 和 Go,都已经实现了局部变量类型推断。
"Java is nearly the only popular statically typed language that has not embraced local-variable type inference,( Java应该是最流行的静态类型语言中, 唯一不支持局部变量类型推断的了)"
JEP 中强调, "At this point, this should no longer be a controversial feature.(在这一点上,应该不会有太多争议)"




Java developers frequently complain about the volume of boilerplate coding required, according to the JEP. "Manifest type declarations for locals are often perceived to be unnecessary or even in the way; given good variable naming, it is often perfectly clear what's going on," the JEP states. "The need to provide a manifest type for every variable also accidentally encourages developers toward overly complex expressions; with a lower-ceremony declaration syntax, there is less disincentive to break complex chained or nested expressions into simpler ones."


Java开发人员经常抱怨标准样板代码的体积,根据JEP。"Manifest type declarations for locals are often perceived to be unnecessary or even in the way; given good variable naming, it is often perfectly clear what's going on, (清单类型声明为当地人往往被认为是不必要的,甚至在路上,给变量命名好,通常是完全清楚发生了什么,”中状态。)" JEP中写到。 "The need to provide a manifest type for every variable also accidentally encourages developers toward overly complex expressions; with a lower-ceremony declaration syntax, there is less disincentive to break complex chained or nested expressions into simpler ones.(需要提供一个清单类型为每个变量也意外地鼓励开发人员转向过于复杂的表情,lower-ceremony声明语法,减少阻碍复杂的链接或嵌套表达式分解成简单的。)"


The plan would be restricted to local variables with initializers, indexes in the enhanced for-loop, and locals declared in a traditional for-loop. "Quantitatively, we want that a substantial percentage of local variable declarations in real code bases can be converted using this feature, inferring an appropriate type."


该计划限制了类型推断的使用场景: 有初始值的局部变量, 增强型for循环中的索引, 普通for循环这的局部变量。"Quantitatively, we want that a substantial percentage of local variable declarations in real code bases can be converted using this feature, inferring an appropriate type.(定量,我们希望很大比例的局部变量声明在实际代码库可以使用这个特性,转换推断一个适当的类型。)"


OpenJDK serves as an open source Java SE implementation and is backed by Oracle. Java SE 9, Oracle's official version of the next generation of the platform, is due in a year. The JEP has the endorsement of Oracle's Mark Reinhold, chief architect of the company's Java platform group.


OpenJDK作为一个开源的Java SE 实现, 由 Oracle 支持。JavaSE 9 是Oracle官方的下一代版本,将在一年内发布。此 JEP由 甲骨文的 Java平台组(Java platform group)首席架构师 Mark Reinhold 背书。
