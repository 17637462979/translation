# 据说,在硅谷做程序员不看学历

原文标题和副标题如下:

> ##You don't need a college degree to be a programmer in Silicon Valley
> ### The Wall Street Journal says most programming jobs in Silicon Valley now require a college degree. Don’t believe it
> 《华尔街日报》说, 硅谷的大部分编程工作需要有大学学位。别听他扯!





Last week the Wall Street Journal poured cold water over one of the most popular rags to riches pathways in the world: the idea that talented programmers could get hired for great jobs as software developers at top tech companies -- without necessarily having a college degree to prove their competence.

《华尔街日报》上周泼了一盆冷水在最受欢迎的世界上白手起家通路:认为有才华的程序员可以聘请了伟大的工作,软件开发人员在顶级科技公司——没有必要拥有一个大学文凭来证明自己的能力。


[According to the Journal](http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2016/03/30/dropouts-need-not-apply-silicon-valley-asks-mostly-for-developers-with-degrees/?mod=e2fb) and Burning Glass Technologies, "it turns out that tech companies are more likely than other employers to require college degrees when hiring software developers." The story noted that "Seventy-five percent of job ads for those roles at technology companies specify an educational requirement, compared with 58% of openings posted by the full universe of employers that are hiring software developers."

据《[华尔街日报](http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2016/03/30/dropouts-need-not-apply-silicon-valley-asks-mostly-for-developers-with-degrees/?mod=e2fb)》和燃烧玻璃技术,“事实证明,科技公司更有可能比其他雇主要求大学学历招聘软件开发人员.“故事指出,“百分之七十五的招聘广告在科技公司指定这些角色教育的要求,相比之下,58%的机会,整个宇宙的雇主招聘软件开发人员”。

For all I know, those numbers are probably true, but they don't tell the whole story. Not even close.

据我所知,这些数字可能是正确的,但是他们不告诉整个故事。甚至没有关闭。


**Silicon Valley -- and the clubby world of top tier software developers -- famously runs on connections as much as it does on pure coding smarts. Developers gain reputations in the developer community based on the open source code they contribute to high profile projects, the talks they give at key events and conventions, and most critically, the programs they create.**


硅谷——和排外的世界顶级软件开发人员——著名的连接上运行它纯编码智慧。开发人员在开发人员社区中获得声誉基于开源的代码贡献高调项目,会谈他们给在关键事件和约定,最关键的是,他们创建的项目。



The best programming jobs in Silicon Valley -- from the plum internships to the regular hires with the big signing bonuses -- go to the coders who are active in the software development community, not to people who submit resumes over the transom. Well known coders get recommendations and referrals that circumvent the requirements on the job ads, which are mostly written to reject as many unqualified applicants as quickly as possible, not to find the best ones.

最好的编程工作在硅谷——从普通员工的李子实习最大的签约奖金,去那些活跃的程序员在软件开发社区,没有人在横梁提交简历.众所周知的程序员得到建议和推荐,规避招聘广告上的要求,大多是书面拒绝很多不合格的申请人尽快,没有找到最好的。

If you're hoping to get a job with an online application based only on your resume, then sure, that sheepskin can make a big difference. But if your programming accomplishments include more than just schoolwork, if you've created software that is known and admired in the community, then that degree requirement simply isn't relevant for you.


如果你希望通过简历拿到一份互联网公司的offer, 那当然, 学历是非常重要的一个因素。但如果你的编程经验不局限于学校的大作业, 或者创建了具有影响力的软件,在程序员社区获得知名度和赞誉, 那么学位也就无足轻重了。



Who you know and what you made

你认识谁,你做什么


In fact, good grades in your computer science class most likely won't even get you in the door. Recruiters at the top companies want to see initiative, and demonstrated ability to create programs that achieve and perform at scale. If you can show that, and/or have a referral from someone in the company or known to them, no one is going to care whether or not you graduated from college. In fact, recruiters for the top companies spend their time combing the software community looking for those people, and when the find one they're not going to let lack of a degree get in the way.

事实上, 在学校的好成绩很有可能不会把你领进门. 顶级公司的招聘人员更看重的是动手能力, 以及构建运行大型系统的经验. 如果你能展示出这方面的才能, 或者是这些公司有人强烈推荐你,没人会在意你是否毕业. 事实上,顶级公司的招聘人员花很多时间在软件社区寻找各类人才, 如果猎取到一枚优秀人才,他们才不会在乎你是什么学历。


Rather than look at the requirements listed on job ads, I'd like to see statistics on who actually gets hired at these companies, and the makeup of their current engineering teams. I suspect those figures would tell a far different tale than the one laid out in the journal.


与其看招聘广告上所列举的要求, 我更喜欢搜索这些公司员工的统计信息, 以及当前开发团队的组成. 我觉得这些实际的数据会比《华尔街日报》所讲的故事要有趣得多。
