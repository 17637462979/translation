In the [previous post](https://pedanticdevs.com/2017/06/java-ee-fundamentals-what-is-java-ee.html), we looked at Java EE and what it means. We did mention that Java EE is made up of various components grouped into APIs under a program called the Java Specification Request (JSR).

在前面的[文章](https://pedanticdevs.com/2017/06/java-ee-fundamentals-what-is-java-ee.html)中, 我们介绍了Java EE和它的含义. 我们提到, Java EE 由各种组件构成, 各种组件需要实现由 Java Specification Request(JSR) 所规定的 API。


In this post, we are going to take a deeper look at what a JSR is. At its core, a Java Specification Request is a formal, open standard document proposal that is made by an individual or organization to the [Java Community Process](http://jcp.org/), that contains proposed changes, additions and improvements to the Java technology platform.

在本文中, 我们将深入了解JSR到底是什么. 核心概念: 每个JSR都是正式的、开放的标准文档, 由个人或组织提交给 [Java Community Process](http://jcp.org/) 进行审议, 其中包括所提出的对Java技术平台的变更(changes),增加(additions)以及改进(improvements)。


A number of very important points could be gleaned from the above definition. First is that a JSR is a formal document. What this means is that a JSR or a request for adding to the Java technology group must take a certain predefined format. A format defined by the JCP.

一些非常重要的点可以从上述定义。第一个是JSR正式文档.这意味着一个JSR或请求添加到Java技术组必须采取某种预定义的格式。由JCP格式定义。


Secondly is that a JSR is an open standard document. What this means again, is that a JSR is a document that conforms to certain laid down rules and regulations regarding its distribution and contribution to it. It also means that whatever is contained in the JSR is easily accessible to anyone interested in assessing it.

其次是JSR开放标准文档.这意味着什么,是JSR的文档符合某些规定法规关于其分布和贡献.这也意味着任何JSR中包含感兴趣的人可以很容易地获取评估它。


Flowing thirdly from our definition of a Java Specification Request is that a JSR can be made by either an individual or organization. Essentially any member of the JCP can make a JSR. JCP membership is opened to the general public; free for individuals as well. So what this also means is that one cannot make a request to the JCP without being a member of the organization.

第三从流动的定义一个Java规范JSR的请求可以由一个人或组织。本质上的任何成员JCP JSR.JCP成员是对公众开放,免费个人。这也意味着一个人不能使请求JCP未经组织的一员。


Then finally, a JSR is a document that proposed changes, additions and improvements to the Java technology platform. This means that every JSR is an addition of new features or bug fixes or general improvements, in one way or the other, to the Java technology stack.

最后,一个JSR的文档提出的修改,补充和改进Java技术平台.这意味着每一个JSR是一个添加新特性或bug修复或一般的改进,在某种程度上,Java技术栈。


Every major API available on Java EE is actually a JSR specification that has gone through the process of being approved by the JCP. All JSRs have a process they have to go through to be approved by the JCP.

每个主要的API在Java EE实际上是一个JSR规范,经历了由JCP批准的过程.所有jsr进程他们必须经过批准JCP。


Once a JSR is approved by the JCP, it becomes a part of the Java stack and can be safely used in production. The JSR process ensures that only well tested technologies are made a part of the Java stack, preventing unnecessary bloat to the platform in the form of adding fad technologies.

一旦批准JCP JSR,它变成了一个Java堆栈的一部分,可以安全地用于生产.JSR进程确保只有经过良好测试的技术是Java堆栈的一部分,防止不必要的膨胀到平台的形式添加流行技术。


The JSR process also ensures that APIs are careful crafted in such a way to preserve backward compatibility. If there is one thing Java is know for, it’s backward compatibility, and the JSR process ensures this very important Java feature is maintained.

JSR进程也保证了api是仔细设计以这样一种方式保持向后兼容性.如果有一件事Java是知道,向后兼容性,JSR进程确保这个非常重要的Java特性。


As a JSR is just an abstract specification, it needs some form of implementation to be any useful. That is where the concept of reference implementation comes in. Let’s look at that our the next installment of this Java EE fundamentals series.


作为一个JSR只是一个抽象的规范,它需要某种形式的任何有用的实现。这就是参考实现的概念.让我们看看,我们的这个Java EE基本面系列的下一篇文章。
