# JDK 10

The goal of this Project is to produce an open-source reference
implementation of the Java SE 10 Platform, to be defined
by a forthcoming JSR in the [Java Community
Process](http://jcp.org).

## Status

We're just getting started â€¦

The Project's repositories will initially be open for bug fixes
and small enhancements only. Features for the release will be
proposed and tracked via the [JEP Process](/jeps/).

Anyone who holds the Author, Committer, or Reviewer role in the
[JDK 9 Project](/projects/jdk9/) and has
contributed or reviewed at least one changeset in JDK 9 will
be granted the same role in the JDK 10 Project.
