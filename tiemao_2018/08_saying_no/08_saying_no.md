# Saying "NO"

# 学会说“不”, 拒绝背锅

I saw [this cartoon](http://theoatmeal.com/comics/design_hell) in a tweet today. It’s the story of how a boss corrupts the work of a professional.  It’s a funny cartoon, and a sad story that happens all too often in our profession.  But who, exactly, was at fault?...

今天在tweet上看到一幅有趣的漫画 <http://theoatmeal.com/comics/design_hell>。讲述老板是如何如何坑死了专业设计师的作品. 漫画很有趣, 在我们的工作中这种悲剧也经常会发生。

到底是谁的锅?...

The difference between a laborer and a professional is that a laborer takes orders from his boss, and a professional provides input to his superiors.  Laborers are hired to take direction.  Professionals are hired to ensure that the direction chosen makes sense.

普通员工和专业人士的区别在于: 普通员工需要别人指挥着才能干活, 而专业人士为BOSS提供各种决策和建议。招聘普通员工的目的是为了执行力, 能够听指挥干活. 聘请专业人士的目的是为了确保方向是正确的。

Imagine this conversation between a patient and a doctor:

假设病人和医生之间, 有这样一场对话:

```
Patient: _“My arm hurts.”_
Doctor:  _“What would you like me to do about it?”_
Patient: _“Make my arm stop hurting.”_
Doctor:  _“Do you want me to cut it off?, I can do that.”_
Patient: _“No, I just want it to stop hurting.”_
Doctor:  _“I could cut all the nerves to your arm.  That’ll stop it.”_
Patient: _“Isn’t there something less drastic you could do?”_
Doctor:  _“Ooops, sorry, time for my break.”_
```



Clearly we don’t expect doctors to behave this way.  Even though the patient is the boss, the patient expects the doctor to have the answers and help set the direction.

很明显这个医生很坑人。即使这个病人就是你的老板, 他还是希望医生能够给出答案, 并提出有用的建议和治疗方向。

Here’s another version of the conversation:

下面是另一个版本:

```
Patient:  _“I want you to cut my arm off.”_
Doctor:   _“What’s wrong with your arm?”_
Patient:  _“It hurts.  I’m tired of it.  Just cut it off.”_
Doctor:   _“Let me see your arm.  Hmmm.  Looks like you’ve got a sprain or perhaps a hairline fracture.  We should take some X-Rays.”_
Patient:  _“No, just cut it off.”_
Doctor:   _“Sir, I do not cut off healthy arms.”_
Patient:  _“But I’m paying you.  You have to do what I say!”_
Doctor:   _“No, sir, I don’t.  Cutting off your arm would violate my oath.”_
```



Which of these two doctors would you rather be?  Now project these two doctors into your own profession, and which would you rather be?

你想要的医生是哪一种? 现在假设你的职业就是医生, 你想做哪一种呢?

Programmers are professionals.  They know more about designing and implementing software systems than their bosses do.  Indeed, they are hired for this knowledge and expertise.  And they have a solemn duty to prevent their managers from doing things that would be harmful.

程序员是专业人士。他们知道更多关于设计和实现软件系统比他们的老板。事实上,他们雇佣了这方面的知识和技能.和他们有一个庄严的义务,以防止他们的经理做的事情将是有害的。

All this boils down to one simple thing.  Professionals are willing to say “No”. When their managers come to them with direction that makes no sense, a professional programmer will refuse the direction.

所有这一切都归结为一个简单的事情。专业人士愿意说“不”.当他们的经理对他们毫无意义的方向,一个专业的程序员会拒绝方向。

Is this risky?  Sure.  But part of being a professional is the willingness to stand on principle.  There are lines that a professional will not cross.

这是危险的吗?确定。但作为一个专业的一部分是愿意站在原则。有行专业不会交叉。

Of course saying “No.” is only one side of the coin.  Professionals are also expected to explain their positions, and come up with viable alternatives.  Professionals _negotiate_ with their superiors until both parties are satisfied with the chosen direction.

当然说“不。”只是硬币的一面。专业人士也将解释自己的立场,提出可行的替代方案.专业人士_negotiate_上级,直到双方都满意的选择方向。

The poor web-designer schmuck in that cartoon was not behaving as a professional. He was behaving as a laborer.  The fiasco at the end was _his_ fault.  He should have said “No.” and started a _negotiation_ with his customer instead of just doing everything the customer said.

这个卡通的可怜的网页设计师的笨蛋不像一个专业的行为。他是作为一个雇员的行为。最后的惨败是_his_的错。他应该说“没有.”,开始_negotiation_与他的客户,而不只是做任何客户说。

The cartoonist painted the web-designer as a wise but impotent victim, and the boss as the overbearing dufus.  The reality is that the web-designer took the role of the victim voluntarily and shirked his responsibility to refuse direction that he considered harmful.

漫画家画的网页设计师明智但无能的受害者,和老板专横的杜甫.现实情况是,网页设计师把受害者的角色自愿和规避责任拒绝方向,他被认为是有害的。

If you are a professional, you _never_ allow yourself to be put in the role of the victim.

如果你是专业人士,你就绝不应该让自己成为受害者的角色。
