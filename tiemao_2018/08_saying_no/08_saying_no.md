# Saying "NO"

# 勇敢说不,拒绝背锅

I saw [this cartoon](http://theoatmeal.com/comics/design_hell) in a tweet today. It’s the story of how a boss corrupts the work of a professional.  It’s a funny cartoon, and a sad story that happens all too often in our profession.  But who, exactly, was at fault?...

今天在tweet上看到一幅有趣的漫画 <http://theoatmeal.com/comics/design_hell>。讲述上级是如何如何坑死了专业设计师的作品. 漫画很有趣, 在我们的工作中这种悲剧也经常会发生。

到底是谁的锅?...

The difference between a laborer and a professional is that a laborer takes orders from his boss, and a professional provides input to his superiors.  Laborers are hired to take direction.  Professionals are hired to ensure that the direction chosen makes sense.

普通员工和专业人士的区别在于: 普通员工需要别人指挥着才能干活, 而专业人士为BOSS提供各种决策和建议。招聘普通员工的目的是为了执行力, 能够听指挥干活. 聘请专业人士的目的是为了确保方向是正确的。

Imagine this conversation between a patient and a doctor:

假设病人和医生之间, 有这样一场对话:

```
Patient: _“My arm hurts.”_
Doctor:  _“What would you like me to do about it?”_
Patient: _“Make my arm stop hurting.”_
Doctor:  _“Do you want me to cut it off?, I can do that.”_
Patient: _“No, I just want it to stop hurting.”_
Doctor:  _“I could cut all the nerves to your arm.  That’ll stop it.”_
Patient: _“Isn’t there something less drastic you could do?”_
Doctor:  _“Ooops, sorry, time for my break.”_
```



Clearly we don’t expect doctors to behave this way.  Even though the patient is the boss, the patient expects the doctor to have the answers and help set the direction.

很明显这个医生很坑人。即使这个病人就是你的上级, 他还是希望医生能够给出答案, 并提出有用的建议和治疗方向。

Here’s another version of the conversation:

下面是另一个版本:

```
Patient:  _“I want you to cut my arm off.”_
Doctor:   _“What’s wrong with your arm?”_
Patient:  _“It hurts.  I’m tired of it.  Just cut it off.”_
Doctor:   _“Let me see your arm.  Hmmm.  Looks like you’ve got a sprain or perhaps a hairline fracture.  We should take some X-Rays.”_
Patient:  _“No, just cut it off.”_
Doctor:   _“Sir, I do not cut off healthy arms.”_
Patient:  _“But I’m paying you.  You have to do what I say!”_
Doctor:   _“No, sir, I don’t.  Cutting off your arm would violate my oath.”_
```



Which of these two doctors would you rather be?  Now project these two doctors into your own profession, and which would you rather be?

你想要的医生是哪一种? 现在假设你的职业就是医生, 你想做哪一种呢?

Programmers are professionals.  They know more about designing and implementing software systems than their bosses do.  Indeed, they are hired for this knowledge and expertise.  And they have a solemn duty to prevent their managers from doing things that would be harmful.

程序员作为软件行业的专业人士。比管理人员具备更多设计和实现相关的知识。事实上,就是因为在这方面的知识和技能才被聘用. 天然有一项神圣的义务, 就是防止项目经理做蠢事, 把团队带进坑里。

All this boils down to one simple thing.  Professionals are willing to say “No”. When their managers come to them with direction that makes no sense, a professional programmer will refuse the direction.

所有这一切都归结为一个简单的事情。专业人士愿意说“不”.当他们的经理对他们毫无意义的方向,一个专业的程序员会拒绝方向。

Is this risky?  Sure.  But part of being a professional is the willingness to stand on principle.  There are lines that a professional will not cross.

这是做有风险吗? 确实是。但作为专业人士, 应该坚持原则, 不能没有底线。

Of course saying “No.” is only one side of the coin.  Professionals are also expected to explain their positions, and come up with viable alternatives.  Professionals _negotiate_ with their superiors until both parties are satisfied with the chosen direction.

当然, 说“No.”只是第一步。 专业人士会展现自己的职业素质, 提出可行的替代方案. 专业人士会与上级进行争取, 直到双方都满意所选择的方案。

The poor web-designer schmuck in that cartoon was not behaving as a professional. He was behaving as a laborer.  The fiasco at the end was _his_ fault.  He should have said “No.” and started a _negotiation_ with his customer instead of just doing everything the customer said.

漫画中那个可怜的网页设计师看起来有点蠢, 不像是一个专业人员的行为。作为一个只会听指挥的打工者, 最后的结果当然是成为背锅侠。他应该勇敢说 “No”, 在一开始就与客户进行有效的沟通和谈判, 而不是听客户的指挥。

The cartoonist painted the web-designer as a wise but impotent victim, and the boss as the overbearing dufus.  The reality is that the web-designer took the role of the victim voluntarily and shirked his responsibility to refuse direction that he considered harmful.

漫画家塑造的设计师是一个聪明却软弱的受害者, 而上级却是一个专横的例子. 网页设计师事实上是咎由自取, 因为他规避责任, 拒绝指出错误的地方。

If you are a professional, you _never_ allow yourself to be put in the role of the victim.

如果你是专业人士, 就绝不会干这类蠢事, 让自己变成受害者。
