# Saying "NO"

I saw [this cartoon](http://theoatmeal.com/comics/design_hell) in a tweet today. It’s the story of how a boss corrupts the work of a professional.  It’s a funny cartoon, and a sad story that happens all too often in our profession.  But who, exactly, was at fault?...

The difference between a laborer and a professional is that a laborer takes orders from his boss, and a professional provides input to his superiors.  Laborers are hired to take direction.  Professionals are hired to ensure that the direction chosen makes sense.

Imagine this conversation between a patient and a doctor:

```
Patient: _“My arm hurts.”_
Doctor:  _“What would you like me to do about it?”_
Patient: _“Make my arm stop hurting.”_
Doctor:  _“Do you want me to cut it off?, I can do that.”_
Patient: _“No, I just want it to stop hurting.”_
Doctor:  _“I could cut all the nerves to your arm.  That’ll stop it.”_
Patient: _“Isn’t there something less drastic you could do?”_
Doctor:  _“Ooops, sorry, time for my break.”_
```

Clearly we don’t expect doctors to behave this way.  Even though the patient is the boss, the patient expects the doctor to have the answers and help set the direction.

Here’s another version of the conversation:

```
Patient:  _“I want you to cut my arm off.”_
Doctor:   _“What’s wrong with your arm?”_
Patient:  _“It hurts.  I’m tired of it.  Just cut it off.”_
Doctor:   _“Let me see your arm.  Hmmm.  Looks like you’ve got a sprain or perhaps a hairline fracture.  We should take some X-Rays.”_
Patient:  _“No, just cut it off.”_
Doctor:   _“Sir, I do not cut off healthy arms.”_
Patient:  _“But I’m paying you.  You have to do what I say!”_
Doctor:   _“No, sir, I don’t.  Cutting off your arm would violate my oath.”_
```

Which of these two doctors would you rather be?  Now project these two doctors into your own profession, and which would you rather be?

Programmers are professionals.  They know more about designing and implementing software systems than their bosses do.  Indeed, they are hired for this knowledge and expertise.  And they have a solemn duty to prevent their managers from doing things that would be harmful.

All this boils down to one simple thing.  Professionals are willing to say “No”. When their managers come to them with direction that makes no sense, a professional programmer will refuse the direction.

Is this risky?  Sure.  But part of being a professional is the willingness to stand on principle.  There are lines that a professional will not cross.

Of course saying “No.” is only one side of the coin.  Professionals are also expected to explain their positions, and come up with viable alternatives.  Professionals _negotiate_ with their superiors until both parties are satisfied with the chosen direction.

The poor web-designer schmuck in that cartoon was not behaving as a professional. He was behaving as a laborer.  The fiasco at the end was _his_ fault.  He should have said “No.” and started a _negotiation_ with his customer instead of just doing everything the customer said.

The cartoonist painted the web-designer as a wise but impotent victim, and the boss as the overbearing dufus.  The reality is that the web-designer took the role of the victim voluntarily and shirked his responsibility to refuse direction that he considered harmful.

If you are a professional, you _never_ allow yourself to be put in the role of the victim.
