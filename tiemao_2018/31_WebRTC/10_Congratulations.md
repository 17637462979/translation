## 10. Congratulations

You built an app to do realtime video streaming and data exchange!

## What you learned

In this codelab you learned how to:

- Get video from your webcam.
- Stream video with RTCPeerConnection.
- Stream data with RTCDataChannel.
- Set up a signaling service to exchange messages.
- Combine peer connection and signaling.
- Take a photo and share it via a data channel.

## Next steps

- Look at the code and architecture for the canonical WebRTC chat application AppRTC: [app](https://appr.tc/), [code](https://github.com/webrtc/apprtc).
- Try out the [live demos](http://webrtc.github.io/samples) from [github.com/webrtc/samples](https://github.com/webrtc/samples).

## Learn more

- A range of resources for getting started with WebRTC are available from [webrtc.org/start](https://webrtc.org/start).
